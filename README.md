# MedalLibaryAnimationDemo

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Medal Library Animation Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a group of stationary items in the middle of the app with a white background screen. 
There are nine various images shown with medal images setup using the Medal animation library 
from <a href="https://github.com/skydoves/Medal">skydoves</a>. Using this outside library creates an animated effect to certain images.

Screen cap images and video of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/javaApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
